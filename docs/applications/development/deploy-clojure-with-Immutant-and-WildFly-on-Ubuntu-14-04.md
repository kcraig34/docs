Clojure is a general-purpose programming language with an emphasis on functional programming. It is a dialect of the Lisp programming language running on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). While Clojure allows you to write elegant and concise code, its ability to make use of the existing JVM infrastructure, such as libraries, tools and application servers, makes it also a very practical choice.

This guide will show how to deploy Clojure to WildFly - the widely used open-source Java application server developed by RedHat. To simplify the deployment process, you will use a suite of libraries, called *Immutant*.

## Before You Begin

1.  Familiarize yourself with our [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide and complete the steps for setting your Linode's hostname and timezone.

2.  This guide will use `sudo` wherever possible. Complete the sections of our [Securing Your Server](/docs/security/securing-your-server) to create a standard user account, harden SSH access and remove unnecessary network services.

3.  Update your system:

        sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

{: .note}
>
>This guide is written for a non-root user. Commands that require elevated privileges are prefixed with `sudo`. If youâ€™re not familiar with the `sudo` command, you can check our [Users and Groups](/docs/tools-reference/linux-users-and-groups) guide.

{: .note}
>
>In this guide `example.com` will be used as a domain name, and `linode-user` as a name of non-root user. Substitute your own FQDN and username accordingly.


## Install Oracle JDK 8

1.  Add Oracle Java 8 Installer PPA repository to the system:

		sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java

2.  Update package list and install Oracle JDK 8:

		sudo apt-get update
		sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer

	You will be asked twice to agree with "Oracle Binary Code License Agreement for the Java SE Platform Products and JavaFX" by the installer. Press `Ok` button to agree the first time and `Yes` button the second time.

3.  Make Oracle Java the default:

		sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-set-default

4.  Check installation by running:

		java -version

	Output should resemble the following:

	    java version "1.8.0_66"
		Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_66-b17)
		Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.66-b17, mixed mode)

{: .note}
>
>If you are not comfortable with using 3rd-party PPA, please use instructions for manual installation of Oracle Java 8 from [Java Development with WildFly on CentOS 7](docs/applications/development/java-development-wildfly-centos-7) guide.

## Install Leiningen

1. *Leiningen* is a Clojure project-build tool. Install it system-wide:

		sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein -O /usr/local/bin/lein
		sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/lein

2.  To check that installation has succeeded, run

		lein -v

	Leiningen will update itself and then will output the version info, which should look similar to the following:

		Leiningen 2.5.3 on Java 1.8.0_66 Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM

## Create a Sample Application

Now, you will create a sample Clojure web application based on a *Luminus* framework.

1.  In your home directory run:

		lein new luminus clj-app

	This will create a new web application using a Luminus framework application template. It will use `immutant` as a web server, which is the default option.

2.  To check that everything went smoothly, run the newly created application in development mode:

		cd clj-app
		lein run

	Now, open http://`public_linode_ip`:3000/ in your browser and you will see the sample application's main page.

![Luminus application main page](/docs/assets/clj-luminus-main-page.png)

	{: .note}
	>
	>Make sure port 3000 is open in the firewall for this to work.

3.  Stop the development server by pressing **Ctrl-C** in the console.

## Install JBoss WildFly Application Server

1.  Download and unpack the application server archive into `/opt/wildfly` directory:

		export VERSION=9.0.2.Final # Current stable version at the time of writing
		cd /opt
		sudo wget http://download.jboss.org/wildfly/$VERSION/wildfly-$VERSION.tar.gz
		sudo tar xvzf wildfly-$VERSION.tar.gz
		sudo mv wildfly-$VERSION wildfly #Get rid of version suffix
		sudo rm wildfly-$VERSION.tar.gz

2.  Create a `wildfly` user and make it the owner of `/opt/wildfly`:

		sudo adduser --system --group --no-create-home --home /opt/wildfly --disabled-login wildfly
		sudo chown wildfly -R /opt/wildfly

3.  Copy WildFly init script to `/etc/init.d/` and make `wildfly` service start on boot:

		sudo cp /opt/wildfly/bin/init.d/wildfly-init-debian.sh /etc/init.d/wildfly
		sudo update-rc.d wildfly defaults

4.  Start wildfly service with:

		sudo service wildfly start

5.  Allow `linode-user` to copy war file into `/opt/wildfly/standalone/deployments`, which is needed for deployment:

	*   Add `linode-user` to `wildfly` group:

			sudo usermod linode-user -a -G wildfly

	*   Run `newgrp wildfly` as `linode-user` to log in to the new group without logging out:

			newgrp wildfly

	*   Make sure `/opt/wildfly/standalone/deployments` belongs to the `wildfly` group and is writable by the group:

			sudo chown wildfly.wildfly /opt/wildfly/standalone/deployments/
			sudo chmod g+w /opt/wildfly/standalone/deployments

## Proxy WildFly with Nginx

1.  Install packages for nginx:

		sudo apt-get install nginx

2.  Create file `/etc/nginx/sites-available/wildfly` with the following content:

{: .file}
/etc/nginx/sites-available/wildfly
:   ~~~ conf
	upstream http_backend {
		server 127.0.0.1:8080;
	}

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name example.com;

        location = /favicon.ico { access_log off; log_not_found off; }


	    location / {
			proxy_pass http://http_backend;

	        proxy_http_version 1.1;
			proxy_set_header Connection "";

            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
			proxy_set_header Host $http_host;

            access_log /var/log/nginx/wildfly.access.log;
			error_log /var/log/nginx/wildfly.error.log;
		}
	}
    ~~~

	Do not forget to substitute `example.com` with your Linode domain name or public IP address.

2.  Enable the newly created `wildfly` site and remove the `default` site to avoid conflicts:

		sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/wildfly /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
		sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default

3.  Restart nginx for these changes to take effect.

		sudo service nginx restart

## Deploy Sample Application with Immutant

To deploy Clojure application with WildFly, you will need to install the Immutant leiningen plugin and configure it for the deployment.

1.  Open the `project.clj` file in `clj-app` directory, and add `[lein-immutant "2.1.0"]` to the `:plugins` section of configuration:

{: .file-excerpt}
/home/linode-user/clj-app/project.clj
:   ~~~ clj
	:plugins [[lein-environ "1.0.1"]
              [lein-immutant "2.1.0"]]
	~~~

2.  In `project.clj` add a new `:immutant` section after `:plugins` with the following content:

{: .file-excerpt}
/home/linode-user/clj-app/project.clj
:   ~~~ clj
	:immutant {
		:war {
			:name "ROOT"
			:destination "/opt/wildfly/standalone/deployments"
			:context-path "/"
		}
	}
	~~~

	This sets a destination folder into which can be copied the WAR file, WAR file name and context path, which should be a root-for-root context path.

3.  Switch to `clj-app` directory and deploy the application with:

		cd ~/clj-app
		lein immutant war

At this point, you should be able to open your Linode's domain or IP address in a browser and see the sample application's main page.
